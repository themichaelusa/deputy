# deputy

Deputy is a pet project to let me work from the comfort of macOS on my Linux code/projects/mischief. It sets up a Linux VM through Virtual Box, and automatically clones your working directory + acts as a 2-way tunnel to run cloned code & pass the results back to your local shell. 

It's really buggy right now & hardcoded all over the place. Expect updates to be slow, as Deputy is already meeting my needs reasonably :)
